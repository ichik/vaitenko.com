    <p>
        In 2014â€“2015 <a href="https://avito.ru">Avito</a>'s mobile website went through a
        series of transformations and significantly ramped up its feature offering. One of
        the things that I worked on was reworked image gallery on a classified ad page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gallery had two screen modes: in-page and fullscreen, the user could transition
        between them at any time. In fullscreen mode the user could manipulate the zoom by
        either pinching or double tapping a picture. The pagination indicator from the
        in-page mode transformed into a thumbnail strip. The strip could be used to preview
        the images and navigate between them.

    <p>
        I used <a href="https://pixate.com">Pixate</a> for prototyping all the interactions
        and animations. Its advanced object dependencies control was ideal to get all the
        small things right, such as taking into account thumbnail strip position on a
        transition to a new image. If the strip was previously scrolled and the new position
        is out of screen bounds, the strip will automatically scroll so the new image's
        thumbnail will be visible.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2015 Pixate got acquired by Google and was subsequently closed in 2016 making
        <a href="http://pixt.io/pc684d694be44">the prototype</a> unavailable.
