In autumn of 2022 I found myself with the burning urge of a new portfolio. The [old one](https://github.com/ichik/ichik.xyz) has been stuck in limbo. Performing a major version upgrade was failing due to some arcane errors. Build times were enormous. Even though I could add a case or more to it and it was serviceable, I simply wanted to burn it all and start from scratch.
